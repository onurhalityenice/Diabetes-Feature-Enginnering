Diabetes Prediction and Feature Engineering

# Business Problem
It is desired to develop a machine learning model that can predict whether people have diabetes when their characteristics are specified. Before developing the model, necessary data analysis and feature engineering steps are expected to be performed.


# Dataset Story
The dataset is part of the large dataset held at the National Institutes of Diabetes-Digestive-Kidney Diseases in the USA. Data used for diabetes research on Pima Indian women aged 21 and over living in Phoenix, the 5th largest city of the State of Arizona in the USA. The target variable is specified as "outcome"; 1 indicates positive diabetes test result, 0 indicates negative.

# Variables
- Pregnancies: Number of pregnancies
- Glucose: Glucose
- BloodPressure: Blood pressure (Diastolic(Small Blood Pressure))
- SkinThickness: Skin Thickness
- Insulin: Insulin.
- BMI: Body mass index.
- DiabetesPedigreeFunction: A function that calculates our probability of having diabetes based on our ancestry.
- Age: Age (years)
- Outcome: Information whether the person has diabetes or not. Have the disease (1) or not (0)
